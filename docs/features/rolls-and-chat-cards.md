# Rolls and chat cards

**Tier:** Free, with some parts in Basic and PRO (listed below).

{: .warning }
This is a test build. It may break. If rolls look wrong or do not arrive, please report it, see [Feedback]({% link feedback.md %}).

When someone rolls on D&D Beyond in your connected campaign, the roll appears as a card in Foundry chat.

![A roll card in Foundry chat]({{ '/assets/img/rolls-card.png' | relative_url }})

## What you get

| What | Tier |
| --- | --- |
| Rolls from the D&D Beyond website in Foundry chat | Free |
| Pending ("rolling…") cards, roll result breakdown | Free |
| D&D Beyond roll targets respected (to DM / self stay private) | Free |
| Clicking a card selects and pans to the token | Free |
| Clicking a card opens the sheet or D&D Beyond | Basic |
| Item and spell links on cards | PRO |
| Monster rolls | PRO |
| Rolls from the D&D Beyond mobile app | PRO |

## Pending cards and results

While a roll is still being made, Foundry shows a pending ("rolling…") card. When the roll is done, the card shows the result and the breakdown of the dice. (Free)

![Pending card]({{ '/assets/img/pending-card.png' | relative_url }})

## Who sees a roll

D&D Beyond lets a roll go to everyone, to the DM only, or to the roller only. Gamelog respects that: rolls sent "to DM" or "to self" stay private in Foundry too. (Free)

The **Rolls & cards** page of Gamelog Config has a **Who sees rolls** section:

| Setting | What it does | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public character rolls | Who sees character rolls that were rolled publicly on D&D Beyond | Everyone |
| Public monster rolls | Who sees monster rolls that were rolled publicly on D&D Beyond | GM only |
| Respect D&D Beyond roll targets | Rolls sent to the DM or to self stay with the GMs and the player who rolled. When off, they follow the two settings above | On |
| Hide private D&D Beyond rolls | Players who may not see a private roll do not even get Foundry's "privately rolled some dice" placeholder | On |
| Show rolls in progress | Public rolls show a "rolling…" card until the result arrives. Private rolls never get one | On |

## Click actions

Clicking the avatar or the name on a card selects the token and pans the canvas to it. That is free. With Basic, a GM can choose what the click does instead: open the actor sheet, open the character on D&D Beyond, or nothing. The setting is **Clicking the roller (GM)** on the **Rolls & cards** page.

## Item and spell links

Cards link to the item or spell that was used. (PRO)

## Monster rolls

Rolls made for monsters in D&D Beyond also show up. (PRO)

## Rolls from the D&D Beyond mobile app

Rolls made on the D&D Beyond website are free. Rolls made in the D&D Beyond mobile app (the one on your phone or tablet, including its dice roller) need PRO. Without PRO they simply do not arrive in Foundry.

## Good to know

- Only one GM browser relays rolls at a time. See [First steps]({% link first-steps.md %}).
- Rolls land on the right actor only when characters are linked, see [Character linking]({% link features/character-linking.md %}).
